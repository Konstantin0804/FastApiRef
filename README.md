# Fastapi + MongoDB template

For launching locally you need:
1. Define .env file in the root of the project with all fields (rename .env.example -> .env). You must have MongoDB running somewhere
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. OPTIONAL FOR DEVELOPMENT install pre-commit hooks (pip install pre-commit)
4. Launch main.py

OR you can launch it via Docker:
1. docker compose up --build

That's it.
